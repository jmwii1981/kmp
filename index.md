  <h2>More than just a march</h2>
<strong class="highlight">Kentuckiana Marching Pride</strong> is a non-profit marching band that empowers the LGBTQIA+ community of Louisville and Southern Indiana — not just through music, but through visibility, unity, and heart.
<br><br>
Rooted in a legacy of protest and pride, we march in the footsteps of those who fought to be seen, heard, and celebrated. Our presence at the Kentuckiana Pride Parade has become a vibrant symbol of joy, resistance, and community — proving that when we take up space, we create space for others.
<br><br>
We are Proud. Out Loud. Unstoppable.
